# wf4ti
#### Gravitational waveforms using taichi-lang
A pure python implementation of gravitational waveform generation using [`taichi-lang`](https://www.taichi-lang.org/) which is designed for high-performance parallel programming in python and allows the codes to run fast while keeping the python's virtues of readability and maintainability.

## Why reinventing the wheel
Current tools for gravitaional waveform generation (please tell me if you know others)

[`lalsuite`](https://github.com/lscsoft/lalsuite) The root of stories of GW data analyses

[`bbhx`](https://github.com/mikekatz04/BBHx) Using `cuda` to generate waveforms on GPU

[`wf4py`](https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/WF4Py) A python implementation of gravitaional waveforms

[`ripple`](https://github.com/tedwards2412/ripple) A python implementation of gravitaional wavefroms with `jax`

`lalsuite` is a huge library for developed by LVK, which are using in 

## Testing with lalsuite
(TODO: testing in whole parameter space)

## Performance


## Usage

## Supported waveforms
IMRPhenomD
IMRPhenomXAS
IMRPhenomXHM
IMRPhenomXPHM

## Suggestion and comments are welcome
Although the author try his best to organize the codes as elegantly as possible, due to the author's very limited knowledge in softrware engineering, this codes are necessarily awkward and clumsy in some place. Any suggestions and comments are extremely welcome. Feel free to open issues or email me.
